"Strategies for Code Correctness"

This was a highly requested topic from the last All-Hands meeting, and it also happens to be something that functional programming is extremely good at.

So in this presentation, I would like to show you some examples of using functional concepts in Ruby, as well as give you a taste of what can be done in a statically typed language like Haskell.

I picked Ruby because that's what most of you are likely familiar with, and I hope these concepts will better equip you to avoid bugs in your own projects!

First, a little about me:

I'm @chrismwendt, and just by looking at my contributions graph, you can probably tell that I joined GitHub about 2 months ago, and I work with Tim Pease and Grant Rodgers on the Search team.

I have used Haskell to solve dozens of Project Euler problems and to write a version of 2048 game that runs in your terminal, but my biggest project to date was a compiler for a stripped-down version of Java. More recently, I've dabbled in Idris, a fascinating language in which you can embed proofs that get checked at compile time.

Ok, now let's take a look at 4 functional concepts through the lens of Ruby examples:

- Array processing
- Pure functions
- Composition
- Immutable values
---
layout: false
.left-column[
### `map`, `select`, and `reduce`
]
.right-column[
### Imperative compared to Functional array processing
```ruby
def sum_of_even_squares(array)
  sum = 0
  for n in array
    square = n * n
    sum += square if square.even?
  end
  sum
end
```

```ruby
def sum_of_even_squares(array)
  array
    .map { |n| n * n }
    .select { |n| n.even? }
    .reduce(0) { |sum, n| sum + n }
end
```
]

???

This example compares an array processing function written in an imperative style first, then in a functional style. "Imperative" just means that Ruby will execute each statement step-by-step.

This function takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of even squares.

The imperative style does so with a `sum` variable, a `for` loop, and an `if` statement.

The functional style does so by composing `map`, `select`, and `reduce` together in a pipeline fashion.

Although the functional style is already idiomatic Ruby (and that's great!), it's worth spelling out a few reasons why it's more likely to be correct and stay correct in the future:
easier to understand, less prone to bugs, easier to modify

- A pipeline composed of small transformations is more intuitive than a custom sequence of steps
- The transformation blocks are isolated from each other, which results in less interconnectedness. Just look at scope of `sum` in the imperative style - it pervades the entire function, despite really only representing a third of the processing!
- It's much easier to modify. For example, returning just the even squares only requires the removal of the `reduce` line.

Ok, next up are pure functions, the essence of functional programming.
---
.left-column[
### `map`, `select`, and `reduce`
### Pure functions
]
.right-column[
## Pure
- Math `+`, `cos`, `sqrt`
- String operations `split`, `MD5.hexdigest`, `reverse`

## Impure
- IO `gets`, `File.write`, `HTTP::get`, `%x{rm -rf /}`
- Nondeterminism `rand`, `Time.now`
- `$global` mutable state
]

???

What's a pure function? It's the mathematical kind of function: one which returns the same value given the same arguments, and does not cause side effects.

Math and string manipulation functions are pure, while IO, nondeterminism, and global mutable state are impure.

Telltale signs that a function is impure:

- Does not accept arguments (then it's not even a function)
- There is a reason to call it and ignore the return value: side effects (e.g. writing to a file)

When you can, try to separate pure functions from impure code because pure functions are:

- Easier to test: no setup necessary!
- Portable since their only dependencies are their arguments, not the presence of a file, a database, or a web service
- Parallelizable
- Cacheable
---
.left-column[
### `map`, `select`, and `reduce`
### Pure functions
]
.right-column[
### Impure

```ruby
def truncate_lines
  n = ARGV[0].to_i
  puts($stdin.readlines.map { |line| line[0...n] })
end
```

### Pure

```ruby
def truncate_lines(n, lines)
  lines.map { |line| line[0...n] })
end

def main
  puts(truncate_lines(ARGV[0].to_i, $stdin.readlines))
end
```
]

???

Here's an example of extracting the pure part out of an impure method.

We start with an impure `truncate_lines` function which reads a number from the command line and truncates each line from `stdin` to that length.

Then we pass the values obtained from the impure functions `n` and `stdin` as parameters to the pure function.

Now `truncate_lines` is easily testable and more reusable!

Next, let's take a look at composition applied in a real-world example at GitHub.
---
.left-column[
### `map`, `select`, and `reduce`
### Pure functions
### Composition
]
.right-column[
```ruby
def parse_query(string)
  filters = []
  until scanner.eos?
    if scanner.scan('([a-z]+):([a-z]+)')
      filters << {
        :key   => scanner[0],
        :value => scanner[1] }
    elsif ...
  end
  filters
end
```

```ruby
class QueryParser < Parslet::Parser
  rule(:word) { match('[a-z]+') }
  rule(:filter) { (word.as(:key) >> str(':') >>
    word.as(:value)).as(:filter) }
  rule(:query) { (filter | ...).repeat }
  root(:query)
end
```
]

???

This example was gleaned from real production code which parses the queries that users enter in the GitHub search box. The current version is first and then comes the new version which uses composition to great effect.

The current version scans for matching regexes and appends them to an array until the end of string is reached. The problem is that it can't be reused very easily. For example, you couldn't implement nested filters (like and, or, not) by calling itself recursively. In fact, that's the primary motivation for rewriting it.

The new version uses a parser expression library to define the parser. With this approach, the query parser is built up by starting with primitive parsers and then composing them in various ways to build more sophisticated parsers.

Construction of the parser starts with a primitive rule, called `word`, which matches alphabetic characters. It then composes a `filter` rule out of the sequence: `word : word`. Finally, it composes a `query` rule out of the choice between `filter`, and other elided parsers which could in turn reuse the `query` rule.

Composition leads to reusability, which leads to less code overall and less breeding ground for bugs.

Next, we'll follow a hypothetical production incident and see how immutability could have avoided a bug.
---
.left-column[
### `map`, `select`, and `reduce`
### Pure functions
### Composition
### Immutable values
]
.right-column[
### Hypothetical production code

```ruby
def index(commit)
* elasticsearch.index(commit)
  log(commit)
end

def log(commit)
  puts commit.keep_if { |k, v|
    ['author', 'id'].include? k }
end
```
]

???

Say you're indexing commits into Elasticsearch and you notice that some of them are failing, but they're not showing up in the logs.

You quickly realize that it's because the highlighted `elasticsearch.index(commit)` line is throwing an exception, so you move the `log` statement up in order to inspect the documents for problems.

However, then you're surprised to find that some fields are no longer being indexed! What went wrong?

It turns out that the `keep_if` method call in the `log` method mutates the commit before it's indexed. It doesn't look like a method that mutates its argument because it's not suffixed with `!`, but the name doesn't matter.

Mutation can happen anywhere in Ruby, so all you can do is try to avoid it so that the caller doesn't need to worry about their variable changing.

Unfortunately, your attempt to fix a bug has introduced another bug.

# More correctness with static types

- ## Banish null (`Optional` only when you want it)
- ## Use algebraic data types (fewer invalid representations of data)
- ## Limit effects in types (prevent a function from performing IO)

.center[![](images/cat.gif)]

???

You can get a lot of mileage out of best practices, tests, and good intentions, but we can go much further with a type checker:

- Banish null (it's not just a dream, the Optional type provides the same behavior, but only when you want it)
- Prevent invalid representations of data with algebraic data types
- Limit the effects available to a function just by changing the type signature (IO, state, concurrency, concurrency, and nondeterminism can all be limited - for example you can guarantee that an API call doesn't perform an HTTP DELETE, or that a function closes all files that it opens)

I want to quickly show you guarantees that you can get with static types. Don't worry if you don't know how to read the Haskell-ish code - the concepts are what matter.
---
.left-column[
## Banish null
]
.right-column[
## 1. Eliminate the ~~`null`~~ keyword
## 2. Introduce the type `Optional a`

```haskell
data Optional a = None | Some a

divide : Float -> Float -> Optional Float
divide a 0 = None
divide a b = Some (a / b)

case (divide 3 0) of
  None -> "failed, due to division by 0"
  Some x -> "succeeded"
```

## 4. PROFIT!!!
]

???

The first step to banishing `null` is to completely eradicate it from your language.

The second step is to introduce the type `Optional a`.

There is no step 3. Go straight to profit.

Joking aside, this is a massively important feature of Haskell. Why the toxic `null` keeps being planted into new languages escapes me.

Anyway, you can read this as "an `Optional a` (like `Optional Int` or `Optional String`) is either `None` or `Some a`".

The `Optional` type can be used to implement a safe division function. When the denominator is 0, it returns `None`, otherwise it calls the built-in division and returns `Some (a / b)`.

This forces the caller to acknowledge the possibility of failure by requiring a case split on the `Optional Float` in order to extract the `Float` inside.

`Optional` is an example of what's called an "algebraic" data type, which is a type composed of enums and tuples.
---
.left-column[
## Banish null
## Algebraic data types
]
.right-column[
## Representing geometric shapes
```haskell
data Point = MakePoint Float Float

data Shape = Circle Float
           | NGon Int Float
           | Polygon (List Point)

bad : Shape
bad = Polygon 3 -- COMPILE ERROR

radius : Shape -> Optional Float
radius (Circle r) = Some r
radius (NGon _ r) = Some r
radius _          = None
```
]

???

Just to give you a flavor for algebraic data types, here's an example of a `Shape`.

You can read this as "A point is a pair of floats. A shape is either a circle with a radius, an ngon with a side count and a radius, or text containing a string". Algebraic data types allow us to wrap this all up in a single data type.

Compared to traditional OO classes, algebraic data types prevent invalid representations of data without sacrificing the ease of writing new functions that operate on those types.

`bad` is a `Shape`, and attempting to create a `Polygon 3` fails because 3 is an `Int`, not a list of `Point`s.

And at the same time, it's easy to add a new function `radius`, which takes a shape and returns an `Optional Float` when the shape doesn't have what we consider to be a radius.

Finally, we get to the most surprising property that you can enforce. You can prevent functions from performing IO by restricting their type. Let me repeat that: you can prevent functions from performing IO.
---
.left-column[
## Banish null
## Algebraic data types
## Limiting effects
]
.right-column[
## These functions CANNOT perform IO!

```haskell
radius : Shape -> Optional Float
length : String -> Int
```

## But these can
```haskell
getLine : IO String
printLine : String -> IO ()
```
]

???

In Haskell, you can tell whether or not a function performs IO **just by looking at the return type**.

As long as the return type does not contain IO, the function cannot perform IO. It cannot delete all the files on your hard drive. It cannot make an HTTP request. It cannot even read an environment variable. Limit is power.
